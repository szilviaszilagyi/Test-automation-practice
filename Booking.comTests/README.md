# TestLab Team


### We are junior test automation engineers and this is our first project. In this project we create manual and automated tests for booking.com. In this repo you can find the code of automated test.


The automated test were made in Selenium Framework, with Gradle Build tool and TestNG Test tool.
We used Page Object Model (POM) as Design Pattern.
We made the project administration in JIRA.

All of the test cases, the test plan and reports is available from Jira.

### Where did our name come from?
##### When our team was formed, our name was Group 5 at Progamtic Bootcamp (www.progmatic.hu). That name sounded like we were participating in an experiment. Associated with this, we chose the name TestLab. So the experiment begins!

### Why we choose booking.com to our project?
##### Booking.com is a popular page for holiday reservations in the whole world and on the website there are a lot of information and function for the bookings.

In this project we would like to show what we learned during the training, so we decided to choose a complex website for testing to show all of our knowledge. 

### What is our mission?
##### We would like to guarantee a very high quality product to our client and reduce the risk of possible issues.
